# autoFGIreminder
This is a cryptocurrency market fear and greed index auto-reminder program and will be updated as the research carrying on.
Run this python program on a cloud service platform can easily remind you of the market sentiment timely. You just need to add your own DingTalk group management robot ID to this program before uploading it to an EVM.
An hourly-based reminder will be created and updated as my original Twitter analysis research result gets verified.
